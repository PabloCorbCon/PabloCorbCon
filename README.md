# Python Jr Dev.

So, I'm Pablo, a **Python** developer that loves learning new things. As I love Python most of my projects are built using it.

Right now I am working on a website that I will use to show my best projects. The website was already built (using **html** and CSS) but I am rebuilding it since the **CSS** was very poor. By the way I migrate it to Django.https://github.com/PabloCorbCon/PersonalWeb

I'm also learning **Kotlin**, and I display all exercises in my "Kotlin Exercises" repository. Https://github.com/PabloCorbCon/KotlinExercises

I'm also experimenting with Unity physics and **C#** but that's still too basic to create a repository based on them.
