# Pablo Corbalán | Python Jr Dev.

-----------------------

**Python3** developer that loves learning new things. As I love Python most of my projects are built using it.

Right now I am working on a website that I will use to show my best projects. The website was already built (using **html** and CSS) but I am rebuilding it since the **CSS** was very poor. By the way I migrate it to Django.https://github.com/PabloCorbCon/PersonalWeb

```python
from datetime import date

class ReadMe:
    def __init__(self, username = "PabloCorbCon", year = date.today().year()): #Get the current year

        self.__username = username
        self.__name = 'Pablo Corbalán'
        self.__country = 'Spain'
        self.__year = year

PabloCorbCon = ReadMe()
```
