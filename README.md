# Pablo Corbal√°n | Python Jr Dev.

-----------------------

**Python3** developer that loves learning new things. As I love Python most of my projects are built using it.

Right now I am working on a website that I will use to show my best projects. The website was already built (using **html** and CSS) but I am rebuilding it since the **CSS** was very poor. By the way I migrate it to Django.https://github.com/PabloCorbCon/PersonalWeb
